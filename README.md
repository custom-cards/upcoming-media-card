## Features:
* Poster and Fan Art views
* All text can have its contents, color, and size customized.
* Most design elements can be hidden or have their color changed.
* 12 or 24 hour display for times and month/day or day/month for dates.
* Indicator flag with customizable mdi icon and color.
* Can limit the number of episodes/movies shown.
* Uses responsive design to scale elegantly 

## Installation:

* Install the custom component by following it's instructions.
* Install this card by copying `upcoming-media-card.js` to your `www/custom-lovelace/` folder. If you're copy/pasting the code always copy from raw files on github (button on top right when viewing code).
* Include it in its own folder like so: `www/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/upcoming-media-card.js`

This goes into ui-lovelace.yaml under "resources:"

```
resources:
- url: /local/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/upcoming-media-card.js?v=0.1.1
  type: js
```

This goes into one of your views under "cards:" in the same file

```
  - type: custom:upcoming-media-card
    entity: sensor.sonarr_upcoming_media
```

If you're not updating using [tracker-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/tracker-card) and/or [custom-updater](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater) be sure that you are adding to a version number at the end of your lovelace resources when you update your cards, like so:

```
resources:
- url: /local/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/upcoming-media-card.js?v=0.1.2
  type: js
```

You may need to have `javascript_version: latest` in your `configuration.yaml` under `frontend:`.

<br/>

Text color options can be any valid CSS value. This includes color names like <code>red</code>, rgb values like <code>rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6)</code>, variable names for HA like <code>var(--primary-color)</code>, hex values like <code>'#ff6347'</code>, you can even use <code>transparent</code>. If using hex values, encase in quotes. This is the only time quotes are required in the cards configuration.

There are 2 space saving configuration options: <code>line_color</code> and <code>line_size</code>. These two options affect all lines of text below the title. These options can be overwritten as well. For example: if you set <code>line_color: white</code> and <code>line2_color: blue</code> then lines 1 & 3 will be white while line 2 will be blue.

# Text Content:

You can build your own strings for each line of text, including title by using keywords. Each keyword is replaced with its relevant content, listed below. Encase this option in quotes.

|KEYWORD|AVAILABILITY|DESCRIPTION|
|-|-|-|
|$title|All|Item's title|
|$release|All|A formatted version of the release time from the component. Particularly helpful for displaying different kinds of releases. Radarr for instance needs to distinguish between theater releases and physical releases. Radarr's release changes dynamically and is "In Theaters $day, $date" if theater release and more than a week away or "Available $day" if physical release and within a week.|
|$episode|TV Only|Episode Title|
|$number|TV Only|Season and episode number "S01E05"|
|$genres|All|List of genres|
|$rating|All|Rating of episode, source depends on component|
|$studio|All|Production Studio|
|$day|All|Day of "release" (release date, download date, etc.) depending on component. This item changes from long form if within a week "Monday" to short form "Mon" if further than a week.|
|$date|All|Date of release or download, etc., depending on component. Formatted with "date" in config.|
|$time|All*|Time of release or download. * Movies generally dont have a time for release.|
|$aired|Plex|Date that the media item originally aired.
|$runtime|All|Displays runtime as either "01:23" for > an hour and "23 min" otherwise.
|$empty|All|Displays line as empty space. Useful to create a break in the lines that can be sized. 
</br>

You can add in custom text to your string, only keywords are replaced. As an example you could add this to your config <code>line1_text: 'Runtime: $runtime'</code> to have line one display as "Runtime: 01:30". You can use as many keywords in your string as you like, you're only limited by what will fit. In some cases a keyword can return nothing, like when using radarr and a movie is in theaters. Occasionally not all info has been released yet, causing something like runtime to be empty. This isn't a problem when it's the only keyword in a line as the card just hides the line, but it can be an issue when you're using multiple keywords in a line. In this case you can use a hyphen to seperate the them. <code>line1_text: 'Rating: $rating - Runtime: $runtime - $number'</code> will display as "Rating: &#x2605; 7.1 - Runtime: 01:23 - S01E09" when all are available or "Rating: &#x2605; 7.1 - S01E09" if runtime is not.


# Developers

**If you'd like to make your own component to feed the upcoming media card:**

1. Component needs an attribute named "data" that contains a JSON string or OBJ.
2. The first item in your JSON must contain these keys to set your defaults: `title_default`, `line1_default`, `line2_default`, `line3_default`, `line4_default`, and `icon`. The default text contents are set exactly like the card's text content config and use the same keywords. The default icon takes an mdi icon `mdi:arrow-down`.
3. Each item must contain an 'airdate', if none exists the item is skipped. This and a poster image are the only required items.
4. If an included item is null it needs to be an empty string in the JSON `''`.
5. Items should be in descending order according to 'airdate'.
6. Be aware that the card strips parentheses and anything contained in them. This is to remove things like (US). Since we can see the art for the show/movie there is no need for that info.

## JSON items:

|KEY|DESCRIPTION|
|-|-|
|airdate|Must be UTC ISO 8601 format. Example <code>2018-10-25T01:00:00Z</code>. This is how the card creates date, day, and time. Doesn't have to be air date, just a date associated with the item. It could be download date for example.
|title|Item's title|
|release|This is a formatted version of the release time from the component. Particularly helpful for displaying different kinds of releases. Radarr for instance needs to distinguish between theater releases and physical releases, so 'release' is changed dynamically by the component and is "In Theaters $day, $date" if theater release and more than a week away or "Available $day" if physical release and within a week.|
|episode|Episode Title|
|number|Season and episode number "S01E05"|
|genres|List of genres|
|rating|Rating of item|
|studio|Producing Studio|
|aired|When media originally aired, useful for when airdate is set as download date etc.
|runtime|Must be number of minutes as integer, the card then formats as needed.
|poster|Direct link to items poster image
|fanart|Direct link to items fanart image. If fanart is an empty string the card will zoom in and shift the poster image as a fallback.
|flag|Display indicator or not, boolean.

## Example from Sonarr component with 3 episodes. Notice the defaults set in first item

<code>[{"title_default": "$title", "line1_default": "$episode", "line2_default": "$release", "line3_default": "$rating - $runtime", "line4_default": "$number - $studio", "icon": "mdi:arrow-down-bold-circle"}, {"title": "Modern Family", "episode": "Good Grief", "flag": false, "airdate": "2018-10-25T01:00:00Z", "number": "S10E05", "runtime": 25, "studio": "ABC (US)", "rating": "\u2605 8.8", "release": "$day, $date $time", "poster": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/posters/5bb9375cb2c5e.jpg", "fanart": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/fanart/original/5b300bbae5cd2.jpg", "genres": "Comedy"}, {"title": "American Horror Story", "episode": "Traitor", "flag": false, "airdate": "2018-10-25T02:00:00Z", "number": "S08E07", "runtime": 45, "studio": "FX (US)", "rating": "\u2605 8.4", "release": "$day, $date $time", "poster": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/posters/5b9983440d320.jpg", "fanart": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/fanart/original/5b9f15a15a9c1.jpg", "genres": "Drama, Horror, Thriller"}, {"title": "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", "episode": "Charlie's Home Alone", "flag": false, "airdate": "2018-10-25T02:00:00Z", "number": "S13E08", "runtime": 25, "studio": "FXX", "rating": "\u2605 9.1", "release": "$day, $date $time", "poster": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/posters/5ba7c2b687091.jpg", "fanart": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/fanart/original/5b48ef958034c.jpg", "genres": "Comedy"}]</code>
